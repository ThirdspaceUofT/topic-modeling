I thought about writing one and linking f and amp ; f to it but I concluded that it would come across as rather passive-aggressive .
But that depends on people being clued-up enough to find it and read it , AND agreeing with us . Big ask , esp . for younger ppl .
It s my first time getting to do this kind of thing I love it ! And will do ; watch this space smile
The Naam , in Kitsilano : highly recommended smile \/ cc
-LRB- last link via
Response to any -LRB- organisational -RRB- initiative is some variant of We d love to do that , but we can t. \/ one for
I can t get that link to work , sorry .
Likewise ; sick to death of union flag , but Pret are dusting their cappuccinos with a cocoa version , which made me smile .
I know , right ? Needy much ?
I love it when tweets have sound effects smile
Ooof , same . All firefighting and not enough making !
Hmm . You say the word , I release the attack dogs . But meantime , continue to out-awesome them .
Oh no ! Any thoughts on ho with if to respond ?
-LRB- sorry , should have said more fun \* and \* \* memorable \* its purpose is educational -RRB- .
But once it s out there , I ll definitely tweet about it smile
Not yet , but eventually ? Scripting an animated video for a client ; I thought I d be more fun rhyming -LRB- it s aimed at kids -RRB- .
As soon as I m done .
Hey , thanks for the RT ! Pop fact : I drew that on the plane , right there , I was so excited to see it smile
Mad props to for nonchalant use of the phrase in silico .
For the umpteenth time : loo roll dispensers that leave the user swearing and with their hand up the thing like James Herriot = bad design .

Oh no ! Mortifying . I hope there was nothing excruciatingly candid ?
Cool , thanks . Have you used other apps , and if so would you say you prefer SBP ? Care to link to any of your work ? smile
Thanks ! What do you like about it that you do n't get from Brushes or ArtRage ?
Thanks for feedback ! I may check it out -LRB- it 's not expensive in the scheme of things -RRB-
I 'm actually a UX architect , but I love to draw and sketch -LRB- months tly though not all as a hobby -RRB- and am always looking for new apps .
Is anyone using SketchBook Pro for iPad ? Would love to hear your thoughts , especially compared against -LRB- for instance -RRB- Brushes , ArtRage , etc.
I was thinking more of a certain kind of person who flat-out denies that there is any joy or value in e-books .
Oh , I still think there 's much pleasure in real books and real libraries smile Enjoy them !
\* snerk \* ; -RRB-
This is rather fun smile \/ via
Ooh , new userpic ! I like smile
VARVE . Have a good birthday ?
He may very well know of me , but I do n't think we 've ever met .
AFAIK know it 's LEE-vo-thigh-ROX-in and car-BIH-ma-zol , but welcome reinterpretations smile
Just at a guess , months t of social psych has been temporarily diverted into social neuroscience stamp-collecting ?
I think he post-dates me ! Had to google .
Attention hack freebie -LRB- discovery totally inadvertent angry slight overcaffeination + chillout music . Onward ! Happy weekend , everyone smile
you both appear to be at the same gig . Enjoy ! smile
Ooh ! I like it . I think I 've worked with people whose desks were effectively varves of paperwork .
grin I would have gone for something like Musikborgensfreude ; -RRB-
Is there a word -LRB- English or other language -RRB- for the pleasure of finding a new track that repurposes an old favorite ? -LRB- -RRB-
Actually , yes please ! Can I just double-check Levothyroxine and Carbimazole ? Thanks smile
You should totally do that . Rhythmitely .
There are a few -LRB- fox in , toxin , box in , shocks in -RRB- , but none are relevant . I swerved and went a different route .
Indeed . Lots of love for the varve .
I know ! I 'm working hard to see where I can insert it into conversation . I expect its use will have to be metaphorical .
Being picky , ` far-fetched ' implies fantastical , literally incredible . ` too much of a stretch ' , perhaps ? smile
Varve is to sediment as tree-ring is to wood . Ish . New word for me :
Sorry , no groaning aloud allowed here .
LOL .
rrwell I do have that whole `` native speaker '' advantage going for me ; -RRB-
A clever Al Gore rhythm ?
grin That 's ace . All my ripostes boil down to some variation on the truly lame `` super-Vilnius '' , so I concede defeat .
It really would . I do n't know how much of this stuff can be semi-automated ; the rules governing it seem fairly consistent .
No , we fell at the first hurdle ! Interesting learning experience though smile Do n't badgers find it hard to cross fingers ? -LRB- paws ? -RRB-
I do n't know , actually . Sometimes , patient guide-style pages have pronounciation , but not always , and they 're not collated AFAIK .
Yes ! Exactly my problem ; -RRB- But in the end I 've just avoided setting up that rhyme in the first place .
Hey , nice going on making it to the build studio stage with the BBC creative studio , btw ! Fingers crossed smile
Thing that is al months t totally missing from Wikipedia : correct pronunciation of pharmacological compounds .
Digressions always permitted hereabouts ! It 's LEE-voh-thy-ROX-in . But I think I 've diverted around the need to rhyme this one ; -RRB-
surprised F. It 's the OX that 's stressed , not the last syllable ! But thanks for playing grin
Reasons why I love my job , I 'm sitting here trying to think up uncontrived-sounding rhymes for ` levothyroxine ' .
Al months t ; -RRB-
Ah , I see what you mean ! But the end -LRB- rhyming -RRB- word and general rhythm remains , yes ?
Wow ! I had no idea smile If only it were Baltic Studies , then I could say `` you are a man of many Talinns '' ; -RRB-
There 's no accounting for taste , eh ? ; -RRB-
Thank you ! I hope you have a lovely weekend smile
Oh , so you want to get all up in my rhyme ? Feel free to amuse yourself ; I have n't time .
I love the idea of `` infernal rhythm '' . L'enfer , c ` est les auteurs .
Good to know . But do you think you remember the rhyming words themselves better than other words in a line that rhymes ?
Hmm . What 's your purpose , when you rewrite ?
Ooh . That 's pretty niche ! smile
After much browsing of Wikipedia , I determine that I am writing in anapestic tetrameter -LRB- usu. , only rhyme is last word of the line -RRB- .
You know that identifying that as Freudian is itself an admission of Freudian issues , right ?
Could run it as a double horror feature alongside a video of the dust-bunnies in my hall ; -RRB-
Also , morning ! I 'm sorry , I owe you email . Things perpetually crazy . In a good way smile How are you ?
I will gladly take them off your hands smile
Today 's question : in poems , do people remember the last -LRB- rhyming -RRB- words of the lines better than words in mid-line , because of the rhyme ?
My fridge is still bitter that it ca n't watch YouTube .
I do n't think I own anything that is n't technology -LRB- or fairly immediately derived therefrom -RRB- .
PostScripte : What are these internets of whiche you speake ?
At the risk of second ond-guessing I 'd imagine she might be looking to disambiguate her own writing . C ? smile
LOVES MAH BUFFERS .
I 'm not crazy sure about my definitions . How would you define them ?
O RAILLY .
But the train before your train is by definition your train .
Also : hi !
Internet = I make things you can find or use on the web ; Tech = I make things you can use to get to the web . But YMMV !
