Gotta love the rally napkin
Do n't spill your heart out , ever . Looking like a straight fool .
Bronson Arroyo and his weird ass leg kick making a run at a no-no
You got to hand it to Bird , great player and great in the front office . No one else has done that better especially not Jordan ...
for sure , especially if you love testosterone filled men playing softball which we know you do phil
that might be your best idea of the summer
thanks for the free braves hat
heard that son .
Ladies say : '' AAAAAHHHH LUKE BRYAN '' Guys think : `` if you only knew the things I 'd do to carrie underwood . ''
2 hours !
what about malone ? Better passer , less turnovers , more points .
and magic was a waaaay better distributor
okay then if you want someone who has all that and is leaps and bounds above bron , magic .
he is hands down the months t dominate big man to play in the last thirty years , maybe of all time .
he 's good , not top 5 . Shaq is above him on my list without question
yeah because athleticism puts you as the best to ever play the game ...
yeah let 's not get too far ahead of ourselves on the whole top 5 of all time
he did n't have rodman until ' 96
how 's that patriots thing working out for ya ?
I 'm loved son
no worries , just know has a bladder problem
Pat riley : Hey can I get that white suit tonight ? Rick Pitino : no , I 'm going on a hit tonight .

let 's get developed , developed . I want to get developed .
he wins this series and he will shut me up quick .
alright , Lebron , one of the best to play and I guess deeeeep down he might have some competitor in him , how 's that ?
Bron could score on Fisher without feet haha
ask the Broncos who was on the field when Davis had migraines and could n't see , he was just so the defense had to honor him
I guess you turned the tv off tonight when Chalmers had the ball and have n't seen Battier play in this series
did he wipe the refs man juice off before or after he said that haha that 's no excuse . Home court is home court
he could 've stood there and the Thunder would 've had to honor him and at least put somebody on him . It 's logical .
Yeah MVP , take Kobe away from the Lakers and Lebron away from the Heat and see which team wins more games . The Heat .
in the last 3 minutes of the 4th quarter ! The dude could 've at least drawn a defender to get an open look for someone else
he will be one of the best to ever play the game , ever . And no , if the world ends tomorrow the best current NBA player is Kobe
yeah different era , Jordan probably did n't get the best defender every night .
I 've said one thing about the guy 's will , I feel like ppl on their knees for him are the ones that get too up in ar Ms
Ripken shows up everyday , does his job , STAYS with a team for like 20 years after he wins the series
yeah Favre throws the months t INT 's in NFL history , still shows up everyday and does his job , not a competitor at all
he never layed on the floor of one of the months t pivotal games of his career in Cleveland .
I guess our definition of a competitor must be different . NO stats prove who 's a competitor in my book .
competing from the bench , hard to do .
how do you spell airball ? or is it two words hahaha
that three was a pure athlete doing what he should do ?
Jordan gets the flu and scores 40 , Philip Rivers tears his acl in the AFC championship , plays . Lebron cramps , lays on the floor . Competitor ?
Girls : Make plans , INSTANTLY tweet about it to make sure everyone knows that they are n't lame and have something to do .

yeah that makes sense , second ond question why is par at the USA Open always like 68 and rough thicker than Gary Coleman 's fro ?
Does anyone know why they are starting on 9 and not 10 ? I feel like your round should end on either 18 or 9 not hole 8 .
USA Open not teeing off until 10 o'clock our time . Already got the yard mowed and dialed before the first group .
no , garden of eden hahahaha
Dear Bloomington , There is too much road work being done , businesses are having road construction sales .

Durant 's right shoulder does the stanky leg right before he shoots a free throw every time .
