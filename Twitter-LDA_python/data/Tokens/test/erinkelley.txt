Making a font from your handwriting sounds awesome , I have to look into that .
Suddenly quite tired , good thing it 's time to go home -LRB- but `` rest '' is still a ways off I think -RRB- .
I 'd leave it - I like the way the curves of the cursive sub-header fit the curves on the seahorse -LRB- and amp ; I really like the name font -RRB-
No , and amp ; I like the design - but if it feels odd to you it may be because you have two `` hand-writing '' type fonts so close together .
That would have made the months t awesome screencap ever .
Wow , Supreme Court actually looks non-partisan . Awesome .
So CNN initially confused .
I saw that , too - Roberts said ca n't happen under commerce clause , \* can \* under tax clause . -LRB- picked wrong clause , still ok -RRB-
I know ! Stunned .
It was that or Red Breast , it was a hard choice .
I think you 've captured the mood better sans flash .
Pretty shot !
Home `` alone '' ... ahhh ...
I 'm home alone -LRB- but for 3 cats -RRB- . This never happens . I 'm going to have a Jameson .
If any of you would like to check it out , I think it 's still invite required , here 's an invite -LRB- until I run out angry -LRB- 2\/2 -RRB-
Fitocracy is exercise tracking for geeks , you get pts for exercises you enter , quests , and levels . Been on ~ 3 months now , it 's fun . -LRB- 1\/2 -RRB-
Creative ! And awesome .
I do n't know about nutrition , but I 'd be game to start a new fashion trend !
You 're supposed to pickle the peppers not the boy .
They tend to be manic panic users though , which may be an important data point .
I have friends who swear by an early or immediate vinegar rinse if you have issues with color bleed - but I 'd ask your stylist !
Has any\/everyone recommended a vinegar rinse yet ? smile
Another `` doodle '' - this time totally of words , on a very important topic : A Tribute to Coffee
I am `` redgeek '' on Fitocracy if anyone else wants to join .
Attempting to eat fewer sweets means all I want is sweets . Please deliver to me all the world 's dark chocolate .
Happy healing thoughts Gus 's way -LRB- as well as yours -RRB- . Hope all is well .
Coffee first makes everything better . Absolutely everything . Let 's investigate what coffee second ond will do ...
I 'm excited for it ! The Little Mermaid 's street cred is a bit iffy ; we needed a new red-haired protagonist . Go Pixar !
If only I could write and sleep at the same time ...
No worries ! This is the first message I 've seen from you , so my twitter blindness was timed well . smile
Hehehe , I love stuff like this : HT
I bet that would make conversations funnier in many contexts ...
Good link .
Wait , bad link , will resend in a moment .

Contrary to what you may believe , `` strongpassword '' is not , in fact , a strong password .
Stopping work momentarily for a mid-afternoon daydream . It 's like the smoke break I 've never needed .
Bummer , I thought for sure it would be a King 's Quest - that may have been my first pc rpg . Good luck not going mad .
Staring at my computer screen , lost in thought , tired enough that the screen going black made me shut my eyes ...
Or maybe Wizardry ! Could n't remember the name of that one , oddly ... okay , I 'm done . smile
Ooh , or Might and amp ; Magic , maybe ?
King 's Quest ?
Yep . We identify with this one , too .
For me , it 's that someone thought this was \* good \* .
Tecnu is great stuff for that stage , but I figure any alcohol\/soap\/water should help . Silly idea , but Dawn for oil cutting maybe ?
I like it when Lana wants to start the day with Wonder Pets , she sings even more often than usual .
Heh , zombie apocalypse , plan bee ...
