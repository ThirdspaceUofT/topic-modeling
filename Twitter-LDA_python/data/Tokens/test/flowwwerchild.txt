Thanks girl . I appreciate it . People just underestimate the power of their words sometimes
I could normally just ignore that kinda crap but after everything today I fell apart when I just read that
getting an anonymous message saying to kill myself on tumblr . thanks , that 's really what I needed .
And then it 's the little things , like Marcus bringing me a smoothie when he shows up for his shift , that make the days a little better
Candlelight vigil tonight for Emily Krickl , PFHS 9pm . Be there if you can and support her friends and family .
same . I never knew her and it broke my heart , so I ca n't imagine how her family and friends feel . It 's devastating
I 've heard rumors and kind of have a guess from reading people 's posts , but I think the family wants to keep it quiet
The death of someone so young is never fair . RIP and stay strong to the community of Post Falls .
Seriously no one understands how fucking much I love The Spill Canvas
If you promise me you 'll stay in my vicinity , then I 'll be that person I swore I would be .
