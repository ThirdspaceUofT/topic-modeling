This what a semi final should look like . That \/ match was super boring .

Pirlo is a genius .
Let solve the European debt crisis .
False

and as soon as he went to Juventus they had an undefeated season . big mistake by Milan
I 'm still hung up on right now .
I am in love with the way took his penalty kick . All class . Nice and easy . He is just amazing .
They did n't lose in a disgraceful way . They were okay . Italy was just better .
ITALY WINS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

LMAO . wow .
1-0 Spain
About to have lunch during halftime
I just won 21 Swag Bucks by Searching the web at
no , it 's a movie
true enough , but I would say that Germany has the easiest team to beat out of all the quarter finalists .
OMG , just brought on . Now things are about to get worse for the Greeks .
Honestly , deserve to win this game because they 've played better , but it still would be cool if won .
Muller = Hot
Germany just scored again . Can Greece score another goal too ? Probably not , but you never know .
So now it 's a tie game
Do whatever you can . Fall down and pretend to be injured , just get it to penalty kicks . I think that 's the only hope
If I were Greece , I would try and make this go to penalty kicks . You might beat them with penalty kicks
possibly . The Germans are playing really well , but the greeks are defending valiantly
Germany VS Greece . This is gonna be good ! ! !
just saw his picture on wikipedia . now .

I 'm pretty sure the Obama attack ads will be coming pretty soon .
I was just wondering why I keep seeing so many Romney attack ads on TV , then I remember that it 's because I live in a `` swing state ''

Off topic : How long is half time in soccer ? It seems really short to me .
I do n't really care that much who wins the spain\/croatia game as long as italy beat ireland .
It must be week on Syfy or something because they keep playing Edward Scissorhands and Pirates Of The Caribbean .
Go Italy ! You need to win this .
Italy VS Ireland . If Italy lose this game , then I will lose a lot of respect for the team . Forza Italia !

Love Seeing Mary Alice Young on I keep expecting her to start narrating it . `` Yes , people will do crazy things for money ... ''
I love how Bobby is just oblivious to everything that 's going on
Like , I just do n't see the 2 guys , 1 girl thing If it were 2 girls and 1 guy it would be more realistic .
And if they were , then I do n't think it 's realistic that they would be macho enough to go and try to rescue her
Not really interested in seeing Seems weird to me that two guys would knowingly be in a relationship with one girl -LRB- cont . -RRB-
