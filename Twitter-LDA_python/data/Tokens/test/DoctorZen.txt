Would you rather than Jesus as your grad student or as your PI ?
You know how you 're preparing a and are running over the time limit ? Here 's a way to make it focused :
Undergrad research should become journal articles . Giving undergrads lab experience is not as good as that plus a publication .
My experience has been that even undergrads have already bought into crappy PowerPoint habits .
We have presentation courses for both undergrads and grad students . Perhaps not as effective as a result .
Maybe . My guess : younger researchers have simpler stories . Not trying to cram everything into the one talk .
Did someone say , , , hootenanny ?
Of course , an old guy like me would say that , would n't he ?
OK , there could be reasons for that . I still think talk quality is not highly age-related .
Being filmed is odd . I did it myself for my SciFund videos , but it would not be my preferred way to interact with media .
I do n't think you would find a correlation of talk quality and age . I 've never noticed one .
I could imagine media presence going either way . Did you have something specific in mind ?
