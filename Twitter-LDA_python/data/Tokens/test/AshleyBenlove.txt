it bugs me when has those tweets that are not quotes . seriously .
okay . i should probably do some writing . that 'll be a good distraction from my brain
It 's Beyonce , after all . Plus , her and Jay-Z . and lt ; 3
or maybe consider Nick Carter 's `` I 'm Taking Off '' as a Buzz Lightyear song . even though it 's Kirk that 's ref 'd .
but , i 'll take beyonce 's `` to infinity and beyond '' reference in `` Single Ladies '' because awesome .
i can only hope that the next backstreet boys album includes a buzz lightyear or toy story namedrop because come on , i 'd love it forever
plus , it fits . that or whatever record company he 's with . or that babyfaced girl he 's dating .
yes .
and ... i 'm listening to that song while looking at the picture . heh .
I love it !
yes , especially in terms of spoilers . And I 'd imagine a movie is released at the same time all over , piracy would lessen a bit .
And you still have more than a month . angry Why ca n't the whole world get a movie around the same time ? ugh .
how did japan already get the new spiderman movie ? how . how . i want to know .
morning
ok i think i 'll head to bed .
and relatives are here . . so ...
if I did n't know the context of that , that would be really freaky to know .
ooh and two of my fills got comments . yay !
and while lying in bed trying to get to sleep , i ended up writing a bit of a fill .
overslept but it 's Saturday morning , so ... whatever .
i should head to bed ...
i kinda want to do the friends with benefits prompt with buzz\/jessie but them having no strings attached sex ? hm . i mean , obviously au ...
14 damn prompts in my folder . and i do n't know which one to pick .
this is the good kind of obsessive behavior , me . yes , you want to write fanfic even though you finished one in the last few hours .
completely agree . while it 'd be nice to have a relationship right now , my focus should be my education
I feel ya there .
hey , lj stop not wanting to do shit
and hopefully having the phrase '' -LRB- BRAVE FILL -RRB- '' right at front is good enough for spoiler warning . it 's not really spoilerific ...
yeah this fic is finished . and it 's now posted on disney kink .
and then i decide to have cars 2 play on my tv . and then i remember , hawaiian vacation is on this dvd ...
ashley , stop dicking around online . finish the fic . seriously .
and she 's apparently ready to have kids . i sure as hell am not . -LRB- 2\/2 -RRB-
and even if they are ready , that does n't mean you have to be ... adele is my age -LRB- 1\/2 -RRB-
well said .
i should stop dicking around online and get back to this fic .
lol , you learned it from an email . really abc ? congrats on crack journalism .
That 's understandable . To be fair , I probably months tly ship them with her because they appeal to me personally . ; -RRB-
thunder ? please be rain
i mean , from my perspective , it 's between 8:44 pm and 1:14 am in Australia . so , i assume it 's like 12 hours later when they `` start bloggin ''
i hate that '' youknow you ve stayed up too late when the australians start blogging '' joke on tumblr . it does n't make sense .
looks like today will be deal with cramps day . whee . at least my heating pad is at the ready so i can lie on it .
funny how more than ten years after i got the scar on my right foot , i still resoundingly prefer widestraps on my flip flops .
ok i think i 'll go to bed .
finish tomorrow months t likely
also , 1238 words written of this fic . so far this fic is total 1861 . so basically , two-thirds of this fic i wrote today .
oh good , i can ignore the daily show and colbert report for two weeks .
`` Harry Potter is dead ! '' -- Samantha Bee on the Daily Show .
i already have a title for this fic . at least i do n't have to agonize after the damn thing is done .
my brain may explode from having to remember two different meridas .
Friday 's always a good day to write . smile
` ya ' and ` aye ' are words that will probably be overused anytime i write brave fic to show that they are scottish , lol .
i should be writing fic .
i wonder if Castleville on Facebook realizes that their advert of the girl and the animal looks like Rapunzel and Pascal .
The first involves going outside , I 'd do the second ond . ; -RRB-
the daily show , you have enough time to make the episode about this . i count on you .
maybe i should n't watch cnn until we find out the exact information .
calm the fuck down , wolf . god .
ok i think i 'll go on to bed after colbert is over . so roughly soon .
wow andrew garfield is REALLY british
NGL , Alice , when I saw that fact , I thought of you . LOL .
i dreamt i was taking a summer class . eek .
ok i think i 'll go to bed .
WHO WRITES THESE THINGS . HOW IS BEING STARTLED UNDER VIOLENCE AND GORE . GTFO .
let 's see the parents guide for brave ...
i would seriously eat rainbow oreos .
are rainbow oreos real or not ?
Colbert briefly had a Pixar piece . Talking about Brave , but left out bears . DUDE , THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE .
Kristen Schaal in a hotdog costume on The Daily Show
fuck headache
well , i 'd trade that weather for the heat basically hitting you in the face when you go outside . yikes .
\* grabby hands \* I want your weather !
103 degrees . just so youknow .
102 degrees . eek . eeek .
is it 96 degrees where i am . not even quite 10 happy 0am . wtf .
AHHH , this smutfic on disney kink used the word quim . djsfakljdfhaskdjfahsdkfasd
omg merida\/rapunzel prompt ! !
i hope it stays at 78 degrees like it is all day . but that 's too much to ask ...
I 'll write more tomorrow . i think i 'll go to bed .
yeah i 'm totally doing this selfcest fic .
i think brave made me tolerate bagpipes . or like them .
i want to try that selfcest prompt , omg .
i should write fic .
i need to get a fucking haircut . my profile picture lies . it 's past my shoulder . ugh
how is japan getting it before the avengers and the uk ?
also , lol , poland getting it in mid-october . by that time it might be out on dvd .
how does a movie SET IN SCOTLAND not get Brave until 3 August ? ! how does that happen ? !
Syndrome is a redhead is n't he ?
popcorn sounds like a good idea
Wikipedia says it was released in the uk in April .
it 's 98 degrees right now . omg .
when i noticed as per silver bird that I had an @ reply I was rrlike `` oh , who 's calling ? ''
of course booth from bones is sexy ! laugh
good morning .
ok i should go to bed .
hopefully it 'll be more book than movie , because the movies are not good with treating ron fairly .
sure it 'd be upsetting if it was that scene at malfoy manor .
it would be awesome if that anon filled my toy story\/harry potter prompt .
and also someone second onded my ts\/hp prompt . hdilsuasdfhasdasd
AHHH . SOMEONE POSTED A BUZZ\/JESSIE PROMPT . SDJFASDFASDFASDFA
Dear Florida , thanks for taking one for the team . Texas appreciates it . I did n't want to have to deal with a storm yet .
of course there would be a crossover with brave and brother bear . YAY FOR PROMPTS . jsdkasdhfasd
i just remembered that kim possible ate salad even after that insane grande size me episode .
lilo and stitch 2 has pleakley trying to get david laid and then bam later hits you with the stitch and lilo sad stuff and kill my heart .
yessssss there 's an elinor\/fergus prompt at disney kink . omg sdjflaskjfhaskldjfhasdkjhasd
wait . am i still drinking soda at 9:25 pm . wtf me .
i hate this cough .
so i love Merida 's parents , omg . they have my heart . pixar , damnit , you and your endearing couples .
that reminds me . it 's been a while since i watched L and amp ; s2
cop out better not be too bad of a mistake
that lasted long
why am i dancing in my seat to smooth criminal ...
huh . cop out is on tbs tonight . that movie came out in 2010 . maybe ? but then again , i 'm not sure i can handle tracy morgan .
nice suggestion , lol .
i pretty much ship merida with young macintosh or young macguffin .
i had a feeling about that . good luck with that , dear ! smile
there we go . smile
there 's something about this music that makes me want to hide . at least my legs are not dangling from my chair , lol .
i also only ever saw jaws once , lol .
oh god , i have the jaws theme on my itunes right now . and i 'm typing really fast and i feel paranoid about sharks .
working on it .
i need a haircut , goddamn .
reading it now !
and this fic reminds me that my youngest cousin -LRB- well , her mum is my cousin -RRB- has a scottish in origin name
plus her visual stuff makes us squee . or just turn into fangirl mush .
i just remembered that i posted a prompt asking for buzz , jessie , and woody to be ron , hermione , and harry today . whoa .
and then end up coming back to waaaaay too many comments to process . playful
i wish the olympics were closer than a month away .
your response about responsibility really tickles me , hehe .
that i understand . i 'd imagine that a lot of that conversation will basically take place over a period of time .
omg it 's 95 degrees asdafad
conversation started . lol .
holy crap i might be going overboard , agh .
neither can i. ; -RRB- laugh
\* lol \* i guess i 'll try to get a bit started .
yep ! i 'd imagine that 'll end up being wall posts like whoa . xd
yes .
just do what you did with us , mention those couple of pages ?
You can always just link to it ... ?
'' -LRB- it 's nice to be saved from yourself by someone who really cares about you -RRB- ''
`` the girl Archer does not have a small temper . It is sizable when fully aroused . '' -- Jessie all the way .
`` He 'd never try to deliberately hurt her '' -- that 's Buzz ALL over .
yes ! and now i have a million B\/J feels all over the place .
no longer considering Buzz a Leo is Jessie 's a Scorpio . not when two of those couples listed had infidelity issues .
we know our own sign already , so much easier .
seeing that there are so many pages ... probably why we 're all sticking to one B\/J being one of our own signs .
i second ond that emotion !
\* sees the page numbers . 900 + ? ! and there are 78 sun sign combos . whoa . omg .
insane fangirl discussions that involve when fictional characters that were n't exactly born could 've been born laugh
i love elinor and fergus omg sdljkfasldkfasdlfkasd
yeah , that 's true . and there are 12 total signs . and x amount of possibilities ...
oh , good . smile
that 's al months t as bad as spelling Jessie without the ` i ' . that literally just ... omg .
and this fic has them spell Elinor 's name the way FDR 'S wife spelt it . N Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise surprised .
hmm , i can see that . especially that horse thing , omg .
dfgikdflgjsklzdfjasd brave fanfic to read sdjfkasdklfasdklfas
well , does n't think too good of scorpio-pisces .
Scorpio high five ! \* high five ! \*
ooh . . this website `` SCORPIO goes best with Cancer , Pisces , Virgo and Capricorn . '' so ... that 's good .
i pretty much am assuming jessie is a scorpio because i am . lol .
this probably warrants a giant conversation on tumblr that is n't constrained by 140 characters like twitter . laugh
so ... if B\/J had zodiac signs they 'd be fire and water ? this is an interesting ... thought process .
i do n't so much hate wall-e as find what happens to earth upsetting . plus , wanting all these movies to occur in the same universe ...
i really want fic about the pixarverse with brave as the center point , but the idea of wall-e being included is really upsetting .
i have too many prompts saved and i ca n't figure out which one to post .
and i 'm pretty much the only one who prompted brave since the movie came out . disney kink , did you all disappear ?
despite that habernero sauce being crazy hot , i think i enjoyed it . mcdonalds is interesting
ok time for bed
great . i have to pay attention to the weather for the next few days .
so many feels with that steve jobs tribute .
so many feels with that steve jobs tribute .
`` Padm Amidala does this in scenes whenever she is appearing in public . George Lucas said this was intentional . '' of course it was !
seriously syfy , you have a movie called `` arachnoquake '' ? are you kidding me ?
goddamn the track `` The Compound '' from thor is the best . good .
and now there 's bagpipes !
and then that frank guy died and now odin is confessing . this is amusing
and back to thor .
frost giant battle and now dancing in harry potter . WHEE !
right now i 've got any of my patrick doyle music playing on itunes , so it might go from thor to brave to goblet of fire at any time .
i should really get back to this fic .
and i 'd like to read some ! maybe even something where this movie connects months t of Pixar movies or whatever . or fergus\/elinor
tons of fanart out there already . but only fanfic i can think of out there is crossover stuff i did for prompt fills .
did buzz just ... call zurg in `` a zoo out there '' . wtf .
I wish there were adult-only showings for those of us that enjoy\/like\/love so-called `` children 's movies '' .
how is there no page for brave at yet
GOP : Stop Opposing Equal Pay for Equal Work :
that 's like asking for the next marvel cinematic movie to be better than the avengers . you 're asking for too much .
also , people that are looking to brave to be better than toy story 3 are being ridiculous because uh ... that 's impossible .
no wonder i do n't really like critics . probably because they 're the ones that notice shit like that . rrlike anton ego in a way
and elsewhere in my twitter feed , nostalgia chick is saying Brave felt rewrite-y . THEY CHANGED THEIR FUCKING DIRECTOR . WTF DID YOU EXPECT .
and aliens too ? ! i love that movie .
omg lee 's baby girl from when ts2 was being made is a teenager .
i think i 'll go to bed a bit early . .
home from Brave . I enjoyed it . I even got teary eyed .
yeah i 'm going to see brave today .
when i read those wedding related articles on the internet , i ca n't help but hope that if i get married , it 's literally just me and amp ; my partner
i really want to go to brave today .
probably just The Tick , Shadi .
why is there an article called `` 13 things ticks wo n't tell you '' of course they wo n't tell you anything . they ca n't talk
well , i guess i 'm a little better compared to yesterday . maybe my grandma 's insane idea involving laxatives did help .
i really hope that at least canonically batteries are n't a matter of life or death for buzz .
i think i should go to bed . maybe it 'll help with this cold thing .
my aunt has the months t annoying voice .
ok self stop being sick or whatever . brave comes out tomorrow .
i like that we 've got rain . we need rain .
at least it 's not like with the avengers , and it comes out tomorrow here .
ca n't believe they get it already .
ok i am going off to bed , i guess .
and omg , we get to see how their friendship started in Monsters university . xd
oh like hell i 'm going to continue writing this noncon fill when i 'm going to bed soon . i can write it tomorrow .
SO MANY FUTURAMA FEELS . OMG . FRY\/LEELA . HDFJKASDFHJKASDHFKJASDHFKASJDF
and it 's awesome so far . i made squee sounds and i 've laughed . MORE .
Futurama Time !
i feel the same way about Brave . i do n't want to wait any longer than i have to to see it .
darn you fic that takes place in the 1920s . i do n't know what underwear was like back then
rrwell that 's good that the Pixar Times guy liked it .
futurama at 9 . 90 minutes from now ish . and i could be writing fic .
i think i 'll go with the first .
aagh , there are two scenes where this could happen . right when she is turned human and then before he turns her froggy again .
and then i remembered what the prompt wants and i 'm rrlike shit .
but i just found the movie , so ...
want to write a fic based on scene from princess and the frog . only seen movie twice . need clip from scene for research . ca n't find clip
ok time for bed
but then again , it is pixar .
I WANTED I cry O BE LIKE TWO HOURS .
ONLY A 100 MINUTES . WHA cry HE FUCK IS THIS SHIT . 100 MINUTES ? !
hey do we know how long brave is yet ?
and i just bought the brave soundtrack .
Yeah I agree . And honestly , I 'd rather know what someone who 's a FAN thinks .
i think i pretty much have nothing nice to say about critics and journalists .
fuck rotten tomatoes
okay what the fuck is the critics problem . yeah i get that Toy Story 3 was the greatest thing ever made re Pixar , but seriously ?
The Brave soundtrack is out . And I am rrlike unsure of whether to get it now or to wait until i 've seen the movie
i 'm shocked that kim possible was on that list . but not south park . but then again ...

well that 's a load off my mind ... one of my professors this fall is my faculty advisor .
ok off to bed

and apparently the filler 's profile has their tumblr and i just found out their gender . it 's a female .
the fic is very nice
ok it 's posted . so i 'll be reading soon . sigh
it 's apparently really long that basically the person is still posting it so i 'm gonna wait until it 's posted all the way
I just squeed too .

I GOT A FILL . I GOT A FILL .
