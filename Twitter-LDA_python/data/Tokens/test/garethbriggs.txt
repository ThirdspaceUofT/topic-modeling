Trying to combine all online and offline identities , so I feel responsible for everything that I do , everywhere .
wow , that s a weird way for a link to bork . Here it is -LRB- and thanks ! -RRB-
it s jaw-dropping , isn t it ? They have absolutely no clue how modern cryptography works .
just remembered Awesomenauts and it s amazing intro too
Electroplankton ?
are you aware of this ?
true age REVEALED
it goes a long way down ! Don t think those players were pro , just youth contracts , ~ 5k transfer values .
some friends had a game at uni : Who Went To School With The Most Valuable Player In Championship Manger ? Scouting was deep .
Congratulations !
Bio-digital jazz , man ! Tron : Legacy s really not very good , is it
I don t know looks like Games Workshop is actually riding the shark there .
Right , looking to go out \* somewhere \* tonight . Anyone even vaguely East London-ish fancy a beer ?
No , I did n't ! Could be useful . Hard to explain what it 's for : it 's a bit second ret-squirrel .
Do n't suppose that 's Simon Katan , is it ?
BEST COMEBACK EVER
Sounds like the worst film idea ever , actually looks a bit brilliant : Robot And Frank
Bit of a long shot , but do I know any orchestral musicians ? Classical instruments and such , trained to a decent standard .
DOWN WITH THOSE PEOPLE
has anyone done a joke about downloading torrents yet , or is it too soon ?
That 's literally taking it back to its 19th-century roots . Leads to more 0-0 draws .
... something about people from Mansfield not being able to read . My heart 's not really in it .
You 're from \* Mansfield \* ? I am from \* Chesterfield \* . I think we have to duel .
Oh fuck , I 've successfully entered the Urban Hill Climb .
Here comes the boring : they 're for aligning cameras , so the whole platform can be seen by an observer .
It 's where the driver 's compartment stops , I think . It 's the one place on the platform where you ca n't get on .
also , this -LRB- relevant at 0:17 , love the scores in the corner -RRB-
Definitely ! Tried a three-way game recently with one football and one netball that worked well .
What does the viewer follow ? Multi-ball sports are really fun to play , but quite tricky to watch .
Love the response that just links to Dona Bailey on Wikipedia .
Somebody have a word with Shearer about game theory and independent events , will they ?
Worst Sonic Blastman level ever .
Sound the New Joanna Newsom siren
second ond one is good too . Google for reviews , but it looks nice , and fair value .
that 's really nice ! Depends on your comfort with drop handlebars . Definitely give it a test ride first .
you can spend more or less : good rule of thumb is intended weekly mileage x 6 .
I would recommend a `` city '' or hybrid bike . Light , road frame but normal handlebars . Much like this
surprised H ! New bike or second ond-hand ? What are you used to ?
similar here , was only asked to go today . Hopefully I can get there .
ha ! Fair enough . Hopefully I will get the chance to actually say hello .
I am , hopefully !
That 's it : I 'm getting up really early tomorrow to watch the sunrise . FROM A FUCKING HILL
Wondered if you were aware of this : Invest In Africa 's role as a front for Tullow Oil .
yeah , I ll defer to a professional at this point ! Good luck !
hmm . You 've got the right address for the feed you 're backing up in that URL provided ? Otherwise , I 'm stumped .
For the whole shebang , details here : -LRB- more technical -RRB- You may also want to look at
for recovering the last thousand , details here :
Do youknow roughly how many tweets it is ? To the nearest number of zeroes ?
how are you archiving in GReader ? Did you add an RSS feed of your tweets to it ?
another hard day at the office etc
cue a hundred people sending you pictures of children 's TV shows at once .
Oh , Facebook .
Cheeseborg 9000 , the Gruyere-flipping robot ! -LRB- cc
... and often different file formats .
used to . Out of shape and working 10 + miles from home . Trying to get back into it .
thanks for running the class anyway ! Wishing you well before next week .
two hours on a bike is loads easier than two hours running , for example , but you ache in totally different ways .
it s different but you can adjust . Just get used to the feel of spending a long time on the bike .
please do ! It sounds great but I can t get players together .
how fit are you now ? It s a fairly level route but a good distance . At least rest up going into it .
I suppose that was a self-glorifying RT . I do n't mind . I love drawing the offside rule .
It 's the best , is n't it ? I love Cammy giving Vega an elbow in the nuts .
did you get a picture of me getting my tactics on last night ?
Nice . Reminds me of this
Ah , I have it on iPad . You 've nothing to fear : Magic is no more or less moreish than crack , cheaper , and about as acceptable .
Best kind of cruelty I can possibly think of . How do you collect ? I picked it up myself
Thought you 'd like this
definitely ! In fact that s quite a tempting idea
color coding makes EVERYTHING more fun . My calendar 's a riot .
that article looks really good , thanks for sharing .
I imagine the scene to be something like this :
anything with air\/space dogfighting , or anything old by GW . I ll hang on until you reveal all .
no proble Ms OK , those five plus Chainsaw Warrior . Sent you a DM with email address . Are you adding any more ?
also Quarriors and Chrononauts ! I think I ll stick at six , although Chainsaw Warrior is tempting my inner GW geek ...
alright , definitely want Modern Art , Mr Jack , Niagara and Wings of War . Will follow up with possible others and details .
Wow ! Did leave the hurdle in ?
worth it though .
cool . I will undoubtedly buy things from you .
how are you getting rid of them ?
like a belt , but too small ; two of ; lights ; general rivetry . Are they some sort of cyber-trance accessory cuffs ?
You think night buses are weird ? Try night trains .
it is way too late on a Friday to incorporate the Bushwackers into a pop-culture philosophy of the real

The Le Tissier of philosophers .
But with Heidegger running the technical commission , goal-line technology is further away than ever .
So good . Archimedes is offside , as well .
... I want to make Philosophy Football into a real game .
For anyone watching the football tonight , here 's the highlights of Greece and Germany 's greatest ever match :
Thanks , EU ! The games industry was starting to feel the heat for a while there .
Love that sign . Seems appropriate in this context .
Lack of distraction , no books , TV etc. . Being distracted requires actively leaving the shop , which is to admit defeat .
IT IS ALWAYS TIME TO BUY AN AEROPRESS
Seen this yet ? ... seems months t logical explanation .
`` a friend '' is the only one that does n't require email address \/ school name \/ similar . Still cheeky \/ weird of them though .
Yes please !
that sounds pretty awesome , actually .
but books \* did \* come after games .
he a heard of the True Scotsman fallacy , right ?
the design is starting to make sense . And on the Olympics , I 'm reserved and conflicted rather than actively cynical .
Have you seen this ?
I am increasingly interested in interactive theater . Saw some impressive stuff from too .
Sri Thong looks quite nice
Where-ish ?
I m not sure . I hope so . Best thing I ve seen since YMBBT .
hi Laura ! Good to see you -LRB- and the stones ! -RRB- again last night . Excited to see what you do next with them !
Good to meet you last night ! I look forward to seeing your stuff in action .
LOVED Comedian last night . Tempted to go to Fringe just to take part !
Hi ! Sorry I didn t get to talk to you for long but pleased to hear Discotect worked out well !
Right .
YES
Sandpit last night was great , even though I only got to see a bit . Want to say hi to many talented people but the day job just CAUGHT FIRE
what was that game board for ?
I like this ! I have the months t fun when work and play overlap .
Yes ! Got there very late but loved Comedian . Really wanted to be in it ! Did you enjoy the , ahem , performance ?
I ve heard a little WD40 can work wonders .
Thatcher s totally , rrlike a big milk teacup . Good show .
Missed you ! But yes , it is a fantastic show . Wish I was in the audience proper .
Comedian Dies In The Middle Of A Joke is the best thing ever ever ever . See it if you re at Edinburgh Fringe this year .
If he does anything untoward , be firm , but otherwise not much you can do . If he finds you on Twitter , it may resolve itself !
Been in love with that man since Simon Quinlank on Fist of Fun .
Kevin Eldon TV Show : YES PLEASE .
I think you 've opened a portal between my bank account and DC 's .
Excellent musical direction , sir .
Comica are typically 1.49 a shot , right ? Are the images good quality ?
Wow , congratulations !
I have a keyboard that assigns F6 to locking the computer . It makes me wish the designer was dead .
Just tracked . Encouraged a target and measured progress , but no points or awards or anything .
used calorie counters before , to track a diet . Failed , but not really the fault of the app .
In fact , why not start a collaborative Spotify playlist ? Remember what happened last time , could work very well ?
As mentioned at the playtest , Werewolves of London is exactly what you 're looking for .
Eww . How often my cautious optimism is betrayed .
Interesting , but I wonder why the producer is remaining anonymous ?
Happy Friday , everyone . Just going to leave this picture of Freddie Mercury here .
Sandpit ! It looked like this : -LRB- My game was outside . -RRB- And there 's another ! This Monday :
`` Klout believes you are influential about Eek . ''
Pretty despicable from there . Please allow Martha to document what she wants , and provide good counter-arguments yourselves .
Statement from suggests they barred Martha Payne from taking photos because they disagreed with her .
To can you clarify why you stopped Martha Payne taking photos of her school lunches ?
glad to see Stoke Newington is keeping it the tiniest bit real there .
Snow Crash news is interesting IF TRUE , which it is n't , necessarily . Also , who do you cast for the lead ? Got to be an unknown .
`` Al months t , but not quite , exactly unlike tea . '' Complain : the mug 's not washed , or the coffee machine 's just been washed .

I have a feeling it will become the Hoover of video calling .
to `` Skype '' .
more interesting to play than read about . I 'd like to see the same game stretched over a long time -LRB- year , decade , lifetime -RRB- .
second onded . Lots of games are only interesting once , as a condition . Knowing the game breaks it .
It 's a hugely underrated series . Know a lot of people -LRB- especially otherwise non-gamers -RRB- that liked it .
Loved your latest blog post . Thanks for showing a personal angle on that Lara trailer .
Yes : delay announced over a month ago . They would n't show that cut-scene if they intended to take it out .
And now , a nice gaming story . A postmortem of SpaceChem , either the best game you have n't or have played , respectively :
I like how she just happens to be elbowing Claw in the nuts .
Not read all of that article yet but interesting how it seizes definition of both feminism and lesbianism , from the start .
great article !
posting to your own FB account is an explicit endorsement of the content . It would still be completely unacceptable .
extensive web-to-speech tools , right through the system .
if I didn t know better , I would suspect you pitched the idea yourself .
SHWP . Surely the sound of a clean basket .
That looks nice . I like the concept . MT BREAKING NEWS : Introducing our NEW game ,
thanks for organising it ! I had a great time and learned something totally new , and I m looking forward to more !

Chesterfield coach driver . Excellent . Three gags in the first minute . It s like I m home already .
Nice ! I will . And thanks for the Mathew Jonson tip ! Soundtrack for the trip home .
Knocking off for the weekend for my Dad 's birthday . 70 orbits now . See you all on the other side .
thanksforremindingmeaboutthefootballBYE
You have n't , and that is exceptionally revealing of my own assumption . That is interesting . Thank you .
True ! Think also lack of context for the tweet was key . It was just `` man said nice thing '' but nobody knew that .
it 's context . Someone can definitely do that in a good or bad way . I know people unnerved by similar compliments .
The transit of Hubble , during the transit of Venus -LRB- cc
that makes me think of Polarity and also Jeff Noon 's Nymphomation and Randominoes .
Huh . Physical dice for digital board games . The definition of You 're Doing It Wrong , but it gets me thinking .
and right on time ... good clear-up of what happened with that paper . -LRB- via
surprised the Guardian ran it so hard . Two writers with personal experience going , `` maybe science says that but I know better ''
I do n't know ! I think you could eat them untreated . Here 's a thing on caffeine in them
You can buy them chocolate-coated , and apparently they 're nice .
I 'm playing . Good Girls Aloud joke is good . I think names should be disqualified .
That study definitely does n't conclude what that headline states .
... 91
Can you tell me a bit more about requirements ? I may be able to help .
I tried reading that article , and I 'm convinced that `` Business '' is a dialect of English that no human being can actually speak .
really fine collection , and a great set of surprise additions -LRB- though I had two already -RRB- . What are you playing first ?
That headline just looks like a load of business buzzwords thrown together : gamification , integrate , disrupt , trillion
can you convert the videos to gifs ?
Yeah . Really worth getting , plus it s peanuts . Playing Bastion atm and it s amazing .

Humble Indie Bundle V just went over 9000 . Braid , Super Meat Boy and Lone Survivor . That is just bonkers .
someone should write a Clare-bot that just responds to all appropriate tweets with that . cc
No idea . That thing is weird . What are those eyes saying ?
Immense ... shame I 'm away . I know a lot of people deeply interested in this however
Next Sandpit is 18 June , Southbank Centre lots of good games , theme of Performance .
I followed you because mentioned you and your work looks interesting . Think I read your Hitman blog post too .
I do n't know ! I made a couple of things , ran Political Football a couple of weeks ago . Some Hide and amp Hmm ? eek stuff .
True . And it 's all supporting characters : Mario and Sonic are huge , but Bowser and Robotnik are n't .
In my mind , I 'm thinking of it as `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? '' , but with MAME .
A zombie is the closest thing to a human that can be `` killed '' without moral consequence .
Cautiously , cautiously optimistic about Wreck-It Ralph .

it is n't a bad idea to write down your master password until it becomes part of your muscle memory .

there was a puzzle involving carrying a jug of water to a fire , using a jetpack . Maybe in the first twenty minutes .
which platform ?
What about the water in Exile ? Remember that being really good .
Wetrix , puzzle game where you contained water in little ponds built with placed blocks ?
It 's just a big old logical fallacy is n't it ?
Rainbow is going to blow your mind .
good effort . Kudos for trying to engage .
I would like to see Space Cruiser at Greenwich . Just throwing it out there .
threads where the author engages are the least bad , but so much of the comment there is just gibberish and jealousy .
CIF has convinced me to basically never go below the line . I 've seen one discussion there , ever .
I love the one just under that who actually writes , `` Being a murdering psych Surprise K as long as no sexual element ? ''
In line with general scarcity of games on all three platfor Ms
