I have to go try on my dress at the mall . This is going to be miserable considering that I have a really hard time just standing up .
This is so frustrating . I am still sick and I do n't know that I 'm going to be better anytime soon . I just want to feel okay again .
Taking a nap and then packing for Maine
I really should be sleeping .
I 'm taking an awesome , comfy nap . Then I have to get back to work .
I might be getting better ?
This video makes me feel better after I am forced to use crappy clip art for my software applications class .
